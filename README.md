# rowland_hithat

The rubber in the Roland FD-8 Hi-Hat Controller perish over time. The purpose of this project is to design a box that goes between the pedal and the drum module.

## Investigation

i have measured the resistance of the pedal, i belive the resistance should be arround 30k high hat open and less than 1k closed.

## BOM

* mcp4131 50K version
* Arduino nano
* 2x 1/4 mono guitar jack sockets.

## Project status

I have created a bit of code that seams to work. The circuit is on a breadboard with crocodile clips connecting to the guitar leads.

## todo 

- [ ] create circuit.
- [ ] design pcb.
- [ ] add a screen so the user can see whats going on.
- [ ] add a rotary encoder so the end user can change the set point.
- [ ] record the set point to eprom.
